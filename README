Introduction
============
The librpims5x project provides C library (with Python 3 bindings) for
various pressure sensors produced by Measurement Specialties

    http://www.meas-spec.com/pressure-sensors/board-level-pressure-sensors/digital-pressure-sensor-modules.aspx

The library was tested with MS5541C pressure sensor, but it should work out
of the box with other sensors conforming to specification described in
MS5541C datasheet

    http://www.meas-spec.com/downloads/MS5541C.pdf

The code of the library is licensed under GPLv3 license, see COPYING file
for details. As stated in the license, there is no warranty, so any
joy from destroying sensors or Raspberry Pi boards belongs to you only.

Connecting MS5541C Sensor
=========================
The MS5541C pressure sensor should be connected to Raspberry Pi via SPI
interface. The MCLK is provided by
`GPIO 4 (GPCLK0) <http://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals>`_.

The schematics of connection::

    Sensor       Raspberry Pi
    Pin Name     Pin     Name
    ------------------------------------
    1   SCLK     23      GPIO 11 (SCLK)
    2   VSS      25      Ground
    5   VDD      17      3v3 Power
    6   MCLK      7      GPIO 4 (GPCLK0)
    7   DIN      19      GPIO 10 (MOSI)
    8   DOUT     21      GPIO 9 (MISO)

Using Library
=============
The interface is pretty straightforward, see examples directory.
